Questions:
1. What is your project?
```My project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors website, where the computer player learns from the user's past choices to make predictions about what the user will pick next.  The user is required to login to play, so the computer can track that user's choices.  The goal is to create an algorithm that will eventually (the more data the computer has, the better the algorithm will perform) win against a human opponent more than 50% of the time. ``` 
2. What motivated you to choose this project? Does this pull from your non-developer past?
```I found working on the cross-campus-challenge AI very interesting, and watched a show about the psychology behind Rock Paper Scissors and found the underlying strategy interesting as well.  Against a completely random opponent, no algorithm could best a 50% win ratio.  Humans, however, are very bad at making completely random  decisions, and the goal is to leverage this fact to create an algorithm that can predict the human's choice with a greater than 50% accuracy.  I thought this would be a challenging algorithm to implement, especially since it "learns", instead of simply doing exactly what I told it to do.```
3.  What things do you not currently know, but will need to, to complete this project?
```I do not know how to build an algorithm of this complexity, nor do I know how to analyze data from a database to recognize evolving patterns like this.  I do not know how to create users, allow them to login, signout, etc.  I also feel that the required CSS and Express routing will be quite challenging.```
4.  What is an object? What is a class?
```An object is a data structure that contains state, and can have behavior performed upon it.  Since JS doesn't seem to implement classes, I'm less clear on the difference, but my understanding is that classes group together similar things, similar to the way prototypes group similar objects in JS.  I'd love more clarification if I'm off here...```
